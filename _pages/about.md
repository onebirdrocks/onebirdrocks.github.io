Welcome to my blog, where I document my learning journey, thoughts, and projects. Here, you will find content that encompasses, but is not limited to, GenAI, spatial computing, big data, mobile development, interesting projects, ideas, and electronic products.

I am passionate about new technologies and tech products, and I love building products from scratch. As an engineer with a deep enthusiasm for product and design thinking, I excel at connecting details with user and business needs.

I currently reside mainly in Shanghai. Occasionally, I work at various WeWork locations, experiencing the lifestyle of a digital nomad.
